## Introduction

I've been working on my personal website for a while now and I'm documenting my process here. 
I'm using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and MDX to build the site. I'm also using React for the frontend and Nginx for the server. 
I'm hosting the site on DigitalOcean and using GitHub Actions to automate the deployment process. 
I'm also using Vercel for preview deployments.
